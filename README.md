# ADEPt-AI-
An Adverse Drug Effect Predictor Using AI

By applying a machine learning approach to Rheumatoid Arthritis therapy, Adept-AI (Adverse Drug Effect Predictor - Artificial Intelligence) aims to improve prescription outcomes of Rheumatoid Arthritis drugs by predicting how individual patients will respond to medication based on demographic factors.

Adept-AI iterates over thousands of possible combinations of adverse drug effects for every patient to predict potential drug interactions. Predictions are made automatically, in real-time, and at a low cost. This improves prescribing efficiency, reduces the time for clinical decisions, and potentially helps to improve the measurement of quality-adjusted life years(QUALYs).
